# Qimg Facts Extraction

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to enrich assets with machine-generated facts.

## Workflow

1. Check readiness with `qimg_status`.
2. Run `qimg_facts_extract` with only requested flags (`caption`, `tags`, `objects`, `ocr`).
3. Confirm results using `qimg_facts_get`.

## Guardrails

- Do not extract all channels unless requested.
- Keep requests scoped to provided ids/paths when possible.
